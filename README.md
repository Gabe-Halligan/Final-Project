Game Name: Dungeon Raider

Description: This is a text based game. Try to pass all three trials and you win!

Testing: I resorted to using things I was familiar with for the most part. If my code didn't run, I tried to figure out what was happening by following the problems section and trial and error. 

Reflection: My biggest takeaway from this is that coding takes a very long time, but it is very fun. I hope to do more of this in the future. The new feature I used was 'random'. I implemented this in the skeleton fight and allowed the user to select a random weapon. The main challenge I had was thinking about what I was going to type before I started. I had a very good idea for what I wanted, but it was difficult figuring out how to actually start. This was a very fun project though.

Hope you like it!
